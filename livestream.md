# Regular Livestream
Regular livestreams are streamed live to YouTube. In addition, links on the web-site and on Facebook are posted to make the stream available through these platforms.

## Scheduling
To prevent a livestream to end automatically in the event of loss of the data feed, it must be scheduled ahead of time in YouTube Studio, as scheduled livestreams remain active from the moment of **Go Live** until the stream is ended using **End Livestream**. In the event of an interruption of the data feed, viewers can stay connected to the stream and it will continue automatically once the data feed is restored.

### YouTube

### Facebook
To make the YouTube livestream available through Facebook, a post with the link to the livestream is posted 30 minutes prior to the start of the livestream. This gives the Facebook algorithm time to pick up the post and make it available to both viewers checking the Facebook page directly, as well through the algorithm that drives the users feed.
